# Basic - Print all integers from 0 to 150.

# Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000
for i in range(5, 1000):

# Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo".
# for i in range(0, 100, 5):
    # print(i)
    # print("coding")

# Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.

# Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.
for x in range(2018, 0, -4):
    if x > 0:
        print(x)
# Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)
For (2,9,3), print (3 6 9)
lowNum = 2
highNum = 9
multi = 3
